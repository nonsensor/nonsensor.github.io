# Vindicated

After spending a lot of time debating whether to bring my entire rig or do nothing but playback, I finally settled on playing my first show back after 2 years by splitting songs into multi-track loops and loading them into the Novation Circuit Rhythm groovebox (plus some longer samples and live drumming via the SP-404). 

And I feel that I made the right choice. If I were in a band that had a dedicated singer, I might be more interested in doing "all the things." But I have to sing, run visuals, and be entertaining. So this was ideal. And it was probably my most well-received solo show in many years.
